# Using the database

Now we can show the databases in this server using the following command:

`SHOW DATABASES;`{{execute}}

You should see a list of databases, including the wordpress database we are going to use.

Now, we connect to our database using the command:

`use wordpress;`{{execute}}

Now you are in the database!
