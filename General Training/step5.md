# Using the database

In this demo, a list of tables is created to simulate what we might have in a database while hosting a woocommerce store, use the following command to list out the tables:

`Show tables;`{{execute}}


while there is a lot more different tables in a actual woocommerce environment, similar to the picture below:

In order for you to easier familiarize yourself to the environment, this simplified version of database will be used across the scenarios.
