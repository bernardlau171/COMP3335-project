# Database security - Privileges

Principle of Least Privilege(PoLP) is essential in ensuring database security. It basically means that users should only be given enough privileges to do their jobs. Too little privileges will make working in databases inefficient, while too much might lead to potential security concerns. 

For instance, when too much privilege is assigned to users, and if any one of them is malicious, they will be able to read, alter or even delete the tables and databases outside of what they are supposed to do.

While the operation team does not have to temper with the privileges of the users, there are also things you could do to help to improve the configuration of privileges.
